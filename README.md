This is The Odin Project
google-homepage project
I'm an upcoming web-developer learning at my own pace to balance out
my life while working. My goal for this project is to re-create the google
homepage. It does not have to function like the google homepage, just look like
it. However, I will try to add a few things here and there to make it my
personal project.

Finale -
This was super difficult, I really enjoyed placing things into the HTML
and live viewing it on the browser. I Learned how helpful the web inspector was
when it came to the CSS aspect.
